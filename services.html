						“An artist who is dedicated to music ! Their unique style is like no other demonstrating an amazing range of synths and bass. Their music will take you on a beautiful journey while you relax and listen to their carefully crafted music. Many of their tracks hit a nostalgic tone with the catchy melodies and vocals. Djavlar.wav will have you eagerly waiting for what they will come up with next! They listen and respond to exactly what you need and aren’t afraid of any critique. The response time is quick while still putting hard and intricate work into the process. The artist is extremely professional! They truly care about what you are selling and they really invest themselves into any project thrown at them. The work they have done for me has gone past my expectations !”
